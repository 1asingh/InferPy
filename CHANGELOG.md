0.1.0
=====
InferPy is a high-level API for probabilistic modeling written in Python and capable of running on top of
Edward and Tensorflow. InferPy’s API is strongly inspired by Keras and it has a focus on enabling flexible
data processing, easy-to-code probablistic modelling, scalable inference and robust model validation.

Changes:
- Fixed some bugs
- Qmodel class
- New distributions: Gamma, Bernoulli, InverseGamma, Laplace
- inferpy.models.ALLOWED_VARS is a list with all the types of variables (i.e., distributions) allowed.
- infMethod argument in compile method
- inferpy.case function wrapping tensorflow.case
- Boolean operators
- Correlated samples from ProbModel

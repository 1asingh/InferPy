0.0.2
=====
InferPy is a high-level API for probabilistic modeling written in Python and capable of running on top of
Edward and Tensorflow. InferPy’s API is strongly inspired by Keras and it has a focus on enabling flexible
data processing, easy-to-code probablistic modelling, scalable inference and robust model validation.

Changes:
- Fixed some bugs
- RandomVariable base class
- Optional parameter for returning a Tensorflow object
- Latent variables
- Dependency between variables
- Definition of probabilistic models
- Inference with KLqp

**Release Date**: 02/03/2018

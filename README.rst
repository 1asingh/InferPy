INFERPY: A Python Library for Probabilistic Modelling
=====================================================

INFERPY is a high-level API for probabilistic modelling written in Python and capable of running on top of Edward, Tensorflow and Apache Spark. INFERPY's API is strongly inspired by Keras and it has a focus on enabling flexible data processing, simple probablistic modelling, scalable inference and robust model validation. 

Use INFERPY is you need a probabilistic programming language that:
 * Has a simple and user friendly API (inspired by Keras).
 * Allows for easy and fast prototyping of simple probabilistic models or complex probabilistics constructs containing deep neural networks (by relying on Edward).   
 * Run seamlessly on CPU and GPU (by relying on Tensorflow). 
 * Process seamlessly small data sets or large distributed data sets (by relying on Apache Spark). .
